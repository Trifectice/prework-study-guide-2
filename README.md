# prework-study-guide-2

## Description

I desired to make a website to help build the frame work of coding and in turn I built this website to grow my ability with coding and better understand the different applications needed to do full stack development. Development of this site showed me how the different applications interact to make a web page function, and in turn I was able to make a website from nothing.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide is going to be used by me and members of my cohort, by storing our notes of the course in an interactive way. As opposed to writing notes, this will have us using our new "learned" skills to update and grow much as the website does.
